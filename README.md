# KNN - This repository contains 3 .ipynb files and a dataset of patients classifying them as either diabetic and non-diabetic. One describes the mathematics used in calculating the euclidean and manhattan distance to find the nearest neighbour. Other one KNN_Model is a file which you can import in your code to use the KNN Model built by me. The last file KNN_Diabetes implements this model to classify test_data and calculates the accuracy which is 72.72% using euclidean distance and 77.92% using manhattan distance. The dataset provided here has 9 features including target variable.
